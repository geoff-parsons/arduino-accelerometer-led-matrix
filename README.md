The Gist
========

For now this is just a simple experiment place for playing with an accelerometer on an Arduino (Duemilanove in particular).


Hardware
========

Accelerometer
-------------

The accelerometer used for this is a [Memsic 2125](http://www.makershed.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=MKPX7 "Maker Shed Link").

    T out -- 1 |----| 6 -- +5
    Y out -- 2 | /\ | 5 -- X out
      Gnd -- 3 |----| 4 -- Gnd


LED Matrix
----------

RGB LED Matrix and serial interface from [Sparkfun](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=760).


Building
========

Not much to say - the pins are all configurable via the code. Connect up appropriate data pins, power, and ground.
